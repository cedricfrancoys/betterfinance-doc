## Categories
Most content allow to be assigned to one or more categories.  
**Articles** and **Publications** share the same list of available categories (`Publications > Categories` or `Articles > Categories`) while **Events** use a distinct event-related list of categories (`Events > Event Categories`).

## Highlights
Highlights are the items that are used by the slider at the top of the content part of the Home page.
* Featured Image: should always be present and have a ratio of 3:2 (e.g. 500 x 333);
* Title: should be short enought to fit on 2 lines (approx. max 35 chars.);
* Content: should not exceed 95 chars. (will be anchored with link);
* Link: direct link to the highlighted resource (publication, article, event, ...);

### Excerpts
In addition with the title, Campaigns pages and pages from the main menu (root level "the organisation", "publications", "events", "communication", "project & campaign"), use an "excerpt" field as a short description to be displayed on the menus when applicable. Just remember to fill it in if appropriate.

### Templates

When creating a new page, it might be necessary to select the appropriate template if it differs from the default one.
